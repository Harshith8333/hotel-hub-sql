# Hotel Hub - Complete Hotel Management SQL Project

## Overview
Hotel Hub is a comprehensive hotel management system built using SQL. This project demonstrates database design, implementation, and management for a complete hotel operation system. The project includes a well-structured database schema, sample data for testing, and an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for better understanding of the database architecture.

## Features
- **Room Management**: Track room types, availability, and pricing
- **Guest Management**: Store guest information and booking history
- **Reservation System**: Handle bookings, check-ins, and check-outs
- **Staff Management**: Manage employee records and roles
- **Billing System**: Generate invoices and handle payments
- **Service Management**: Track additional services and amenities
- **Reporting**: Generate various reports for management insights

## Database Schema
The database includes the following main tables:
- `guests` - Guest information and contact details
- `rooms` - Room details, types, and pricing
- `reservations` - Booking information and status
- `staff` - Employee records and roles
- `services` - Additional hotel services
- `billing` - Invoice and payment records
- `room_types` - Different room categories and specifications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MySQL 5.7+ or PostgreSQL 10+
- SQL client (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or similar)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshith8333/hotel-hub-sql.git
   cd hotel-hub-sql
   ```

2. Create a new database
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE hotel_hub;
   USE hotel_hub;
   ```

3. Run the schema creation scripts
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p hotel_hub < schema/create_tables.sql
   mysql -u your_username -p hotel_hub < schema/constraints.sql
   mysql -u your_username -p hotel_hub < schema/indexes.sql
   ```

4. Load sample data
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p hotel_hub < data/sample_data.sql
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Check Room Availability
```sql
SELECT r.room_number, rt.type_name, r.price_per_night
FROM rooms r
JOIN room_types rt ON r.room_type_id = rt.id
WHERE r.status = 'available'
ORDER BY r.price_per_night;
```

### Get Guest Booking History
```sql
SELECT g.first_name, g.last_name, res.check_in_date, res.check_out_date, r.room_number
FROM guests g
JOIN reservations res ON g.id = res.guest_id
JOIN rooms r ON res.room_id = r.id
WHERE g.id = 1
ORDER BY res.check_in_date DESC;
```

### Revenue Report
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(check_in_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
    COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM reservations
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(check_in_date, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month DESC;
```
